<h1>Hi.</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Ethan. Follower of Jesus, husband, developer, and enjoyer of simplicity.
        Here in my small corner of the world you can find links to my projects, random writings about things, and stuff I
        enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
        The WIP goal for this page is a home to the things I consider "core" to me. We'll see how that pans out over 2023.
