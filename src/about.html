<h1>Hi.</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Ethan. Follower of Jesus, husband, graphic designer, developer, and enjoyer of pop punk music.
        Here in my small corner of the world you can find links to my projects, random writings about things, and stuff I
        enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
        The WIP goal for this page is a home to the things I consider "core" to me. If you have any questions, life is full of mystery.
