## {{ title }}

I find that consistent happenings make for a good opportunity to reflect on personal change/growth, especially yearly events that rarely change themselves. A year ago this weekend, I was at one of these annual happenings, feeling pretty hopeless. I was waiting on news, news that I hoped would be good and news that could potentially change a big portion of my life. I hadn't received _bad_ news up to this point, but it was more that I had been in a period of waiting for over a month, and I was feeling stuck, at the mercy of greater forces that I couldn't change.

I wouldn't get an answer for another 2 months, but it was all worth it. In the end, God's timing was just right, and I get to reflect back on everything now with some serious gratitude. Gratitude not just for the desired good news, but gratitude for how God took something I felt led to, and used it for His glory.

I've been trying to find some more interesting, maybe even poetic, words to use to describe how I'm feeling, but maybe that's not necessary. Mostly, I'm thankful.
