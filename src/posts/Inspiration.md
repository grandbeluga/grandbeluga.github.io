Two Saturdays ago, the 14th, I had the privilege of seeing my favorite artist in concert: [Owl City](https://owlcity.com/).
I'm not a regular concert goer, so it's taken me some time to get around to seeing Adam, and it was not a disappointment. He's a great musician, fun performer, and definitely worth seeing live. Although there were a few more songs I would have wanted to hear, the set list was excellent. I don't get very emotionally into live music, and this show was no exception. However, from the moment he took the stage, I was constantly reminded why he's my favorite musician. 

Inspiration is a fickle beast that can't be relied on. I've yet to learn how to confidently navigate between good habits and the spur of the moment *I gotta get this done right now* ideas that show up without warning. Regardless, I believe in seeking out that which inspires you and continuing to enjoy where it can take you. Adam Young and his many musical projects have always done that for me. His music helps me wonder, imagine, and seek out the magical things in life. There's a lot to wonder about, and I've been doing it a lot more lately. I'm thankful for it.

I'm going to try out posting on Mondays (I say, posting this on a Tuesday), as my mental presence at my desk on Fridays can be more hit or miss. Thanks for reading.
