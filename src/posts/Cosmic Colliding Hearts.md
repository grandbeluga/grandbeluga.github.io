## {{ title }}

Sometimes things collide.

Take stars, for example. Formidable, powerful, and some of the most beautiful things in the universe. On their own, they're giant sources of energy that exist independently. But, as soon as they collide, it's like something you can barely even imagine. Anything nearby feels the effects for a very long time and the result can be pure destruction or something incredibly beautiful. Even after it's over the ghosts stick around in the sky because something like that always leaves a mark.

Sometimes people are like stars.
