## {{ title }}

i stood on the porch, looking out over the lazy waves, and wondering what would come next. the moons were bright tonight, illuminating the various piers in that familar orange glow. it had already been 7 years since Albiion, but nights like these still brought back memories. it was time for a walk. as i passed sleepy cabins, i became lost in thoughts of starlit coves, golden hours, and days spent searching, hopelessly. the memories blurred together at this point, making it hard to know what was still real. but i knew she was real. if anything from that endless prison was real, it was her. i hope.

i had reached the end of the street. on a clear night like this, you could make out the Echelon field, shimmering out beyond the gates. for a moment, i thought i saw a shooting star.
