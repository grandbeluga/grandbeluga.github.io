<p>Another...morning, I suppose. It stormed last night, resulting in better sleep than has been had in a few months. Woke up feeling a little more ready to keep living, as opposed to the general fight to keep going.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what it is about rainy days, but they're inspiring in a very specific way. We all feel it, but I'm wondering how to best describe it. Quiet, subdued, and thoughtful. It's a mood I don't naturally find myself in very often, but could use more of. Throw on an ambient track and take a walk with something good and warm in your travel mug. Walking past coffee shops, cars, and disappearing into a sea of others looking to be somewhere. What if we didn't have anywhere to go?</p>
