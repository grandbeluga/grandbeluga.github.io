&lt;p&gt;On a fall morning like this, the eastern seaboard is misty and bright. Many a tall tale has passed through this port, for sailors always find something to blame for their lack of haul. But there is something to be said for the sense of unknown found at the edge of a pier. Hours could pass here with the only sound being the familiar creaking of mired wood and sloshing of waves against the old stones that kept guard on the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to get lost in thought, lost in memories. I can&#39;t help myself. I&#39;ve always found it easier to stay lost, especially somewhere I&#39;ve never been. Eventually the sun will go down, lights will dim, and dreams will overtake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaves have already started falling. What once was August and the promise of cooler days will soon give way to even colder, longer nights. It won&#39;t be long now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere, far beyond the horizon, a lighthouse stands resolute.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>mid year update</title>

    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;mid year update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just occured to this morning that the year is half over and I&#39;ve barely used this blog! I&#39;ve been taking a little bit of a head down approach to projects, etc., so I think it&#39;s made me hesitant to talk about anything until I had a solid grip on what I was actually doing. But really, that&#39;s an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Recently I have been...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading Lord of the Rings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading through the whole Bible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imitating film photographer on my dslr via a great set of presets and shooting at 35mm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on a 3-5 song ambient EP for my project &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/6UquNOSvZgtbMeTK6drFR8?si=1VZH0KrCSMmcO0t-KXW-vQ&quot;&gt;time stops at sunset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demoing our downstairs bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practicing character pixel art, specifically by making characters for a pathfinder campaign I&#39;m in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking chemex coffee again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning how to code at work, although I still feel like I have no idea what I&#39;m doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not playing video games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A few things worth noting...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to give up video games for the month of July to see what else I can spend time on and enjoy, to great results so far. It&#39;s made me think a lot about how I spend my time and that I was probably a bit of an addict. It&#39;s only been a week, and the results have definitely been a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s my hope to complete the EP over the course of July-August, with an August release date. We&#39;ll see if that happens, but I&#39;m feeling positive! A September release date will be entirely acceptable if it&#39;s because the tracks need more time in the oven. I&#39;m trying to use this experience to learn as much as I can and still create something I&#39;m really, really proud of. If you like ambient music, you can check out the two songs I already have out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/6UquNOSvZgtbMeTK6drFR8?si=1VZH0KrCSMmcO0t-KXW-vQ&quot;&gt;spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bathroom project should be done by the end of the year, but sooner is the goal. There are still some unknowns to be discovered in the demoing process, but I&#39;ve already gained significant confidence in my ability to work on such things, which was very needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixel art is so sick. I love doing it. It&#39;s up there with photography as a hobby that I got into &amp;quot;later&amp;quot; in life and has been so good for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what I &lt;em&gt;haven&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; been doing much lately? Writing. I might have to buckle down and crank out some more blog posts soon. I&#39;m just bursting with &lt;em&gt;soooo&lt;/em&gt; many great ideas and thoughts the world just &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to hear. More seriously, I think it&#39;s interesting how much writing helps me remember who I am. I&#39;m not really sure how to explain that any more clearly at the moment, so do with it what you will. My cat Mo is currently trying to eat a box, so I&#39;m gonna call it here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Missing home, again.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden haze, dancing across the tops of the grass. These memories are etched into your very being, sewn into the fabric of your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There comes a point in growing up where you have to face the brevity of the past; it flew by without even bothering to give you a warning before it was gone. At least, that’s how it feels. Unbeknownst to the hurting heart, memories never leave us, and neither do those moments. Caught in time, those evenings wrote themselves into eternity. As the sun draped itself across the fields and into our minds eye, we created something that’ll never be lost. Each second just as precious as the last. Close your eyes, find yourself back home. It’s not far now. Halcyon horizons, beckoning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2023</title>

    <id>https://whaies.dev/posts/2023/</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February was a bit of a drab month for a few reasons, and March is already almost over. It&#39;s difficult to find inspiration at this time of year, to say the very least. However, 2023 has started off differently in a way I believe is worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t necessarily believe every year needs to be given a title or a theme, as I think many of them develop regardless of my input. That said, I felt that 2023 was deserving of a little more intentionality. Throughout Jan-Feb, patterns emerged and developed into some words that I wrote down on February 9th. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vintage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halcyon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m desiring a tender, reverent perspective towards the immutable. What&#39;s good in life and how do we cling to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus created this world, and, despite it&#39;s broken state, I believe there is so much good in it. I want to find those things, praise Him for them, and keep a level head by routinely immersing myself into them and what they give back. One of the ways I&#39;m attempting this is by refining the hobbies I&#39;ve had into simpler forms. For example, pixel art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://whaies.dev/images/space2.png&quot; alt=&quot;space pixel art&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixel art is a digital art form that&#39;s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; had my heart, but I never felt brave enough to try it myself. It&#39;s been both greatly enjoyable and almost edifying, as it&#39;s challenged my drawing skills while also simplifying them. There are only so many ways you can use a pixel at a time, but it&#39;s strangely effective. I find the process very gratifying and grounded. It reminds me of simpler times, old video games, and nostalgic moments. It&#39;s brought me great joy to immerse myself in the various styles, learning what I&#39;m drawn to and how I can craft my own style out of what already works. It&#39;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list will be film photography. I&#39;ve got the film and a camera that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; work, but I keep avoiding it because of said camera. But I&#39;ve got some trips coming up next month and the deadline is ticking, so it won&#39;t be long now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole post feels like I&#39;m rambling, so I think I&#39;ll call it for now. I mostly wanted to get back up on the blog post horse, as writing more often is another desire of mine for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://whaies.dev/images/sunset_and_windmills2l.png&quot; alt=&quot;space pixel art&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet me out in the drift, where time stops as the sun goes down. The light is dancing in your eyes as this moment etches itself onto our souls. Right now, there&#39;s nothing more than you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each breath like a wave that crashes across the skies, reaching out to eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartbeats that cascade into each other, colliding in sparks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like stars meeting for the first time, nothing will ever be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleeting words and desperate attempts to measure things beyond. You&#39;ll reach for it forever, but never quite catch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;clunk&lt;/em&gt; another dart finding its mark a little further south west than desired, resulting in an eruption of inebriated groans. why do bars all seem to smell the same? I suppose years of smoking, drinking, and sweating eventually sink into their surroundings, albeit slowly. suspiciously tacky surfaces, obvious regulars, and the constant feeling of &amp;quot;why am I here?&amp;quot; but, I must admit there is something endearing about it. after all, I&#39;m sitting here writing about it while slowly sipping on something overpriced. people pass through, bringing their stories with them, and always leaving a little piece behind. human spaces are strengthened by the history they create, and anywhere that serves decent food and drink will likely steward over a wealth of hearty laughs, stolen glances, &amp;quot;remember that time?&amp;quot;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i stood on the porch, looking out over the lazy waves, and wondering what would come next. the moons were bright tonight, illuminating the various piers in that familar orange glow. it had already been 7 years since Albiion, but nights like these still brought back memories. it was time for a walk. as i passed sleepy cabins, i became lost in thoughts of starlit coves, golden hours, and days spent searching, hopelessly. the memories blurred together at this point, making it hard to know what was still real. but i knew she was real. if anything from that endless prison was real, it was her. i hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i had reached the end of the street. on a clear night like this, you could make out the Echelon field, shimmering out beyond the gates. for a moment, i thought i saw a shooting star.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Into the Wilds</title>
    <link href="https://whaies.dev/posts/Into%20the%20Wilds/"/>

    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Into the Wilds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes, it just feels like there are no words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;although I prefer not to hide my hobbies from anyone, gaming is not always viewed positively by others. therefore, i find it worthwhile to only talk about it in settings where it&#39;s going to result in productive conversation. i think this is a fair principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently completed the only DLC for Outer Wilds, known as Echoes of the Eye. I could talk about how deeply Outer Wilds affected me, throwing my hat in the ring with so many others. it is a piece of art that reaches right into the soul and leaves a mark you never knew you were missing. any artistic media that deals with the concept of time tends to do this, as we as finite beings can&#39;t quite wrap our heads around the idea of no longer being beholden to the constant demands of entropy that come with &amp;quot;time.&amp;quot; it&#39;s just not within our scope of understanding at this point. Outer Wilds appreciation is a subject of its own that I&#39;ll only refer back to as relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the story and experience of Echoes is a much smaller scope, naturally, as it serves as an addition to the base story. and it does this so well. because of this, I found the story and its ending to be sweet in a way that easily stands as its own incredible section of the Outer Wilds experience. the prisoner, freed. a friend made at the end of time. choosing to step into the great unknown with only the assurance that you knew who and what you loved in your limited time. knowing that&#39;s enough. holding onto the promise that love matters. what you experienced matters, even when it&#39;s unfairly cut short or painfully, unnaturally lengthened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this sticks with me in a way that i fail to describe. for followers of Jesus, we know what comes next. the great unknown isn&#39;t really unknown. but we were created to recognize and create beauty, and I believe that the beauty we recognize in finality is special and worth dwelling with from time to time. this small piece of reality, one that will end, forces us to contend with loss, pain, and choosing what to recognize as good. love. friendship. connection. it&#39;s no surprise that we hold these so deeply, with a God like ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;although Outer Wilds contains only a sliver of the light and beauty resulting from the fingerprint of God on His people, I believe it does all it can with it. it is a story that wastes no time on the meaingless, but chooses to spend all of its time with all that is irreplaceably human.&lt;/p&gt;
