                <h2>Gratitude.</h2>
<p>I find that consistent happenings make for a good opportunity to reflect on personal change/growth, especially yearly events that rarely change themselves. A year ago this weekend, I was at one of these annual happenings, feeling pretty hopeless. I was waiting on news, news that I hoped would be good and news that could potentially change a big portion of my life. I hadn't received <em>bad</em> news up to this point, but it was more that I had been in a period of waiting for over a month, and I was feeling stuck, at the mercy of greater forces that I couldn't change.</p>
<p>I wouldn't get an answer for another 2 months, but it was all worth it. In the end, God's timing was just right, and I get to reflect back on everything now with some serious gratitude. Gratitude not just for the desired good news, but gratitude for how God took something I felt led to, and used it for His glory.</p>
<p>I've been trying to find some more interesting, maybe even poetic, words to use to describe how I'm feeling, but maybe that's not necessary. Mostly, I'm thankful.</p>
