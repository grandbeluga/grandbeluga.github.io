                <h2>waiting</h2>
<p>On Monday of this week, I started a <a href="https://www.theaquariumwiki.com/wiki/Walstad_method">Walstad</a> planted tank. I’d planned to do this about a year ago, but life got busy and I decided I wasn’t really in the place for it. The idea is simple: 1-2 inches of dirt, capped with half as much sand, but not too fine of a sand that air and plant roots can’t get through. Gently fill the tank with water so as to not create a giant cloud of sand and dirt, plant a bunch of easy level water plants in said sand, and…wait. All you can really do now is have a good light routine. Diana Walstad herself recommends some version of 5 hours on, 4 hours off, 5 hours on, bedtime.</p>
<p>Waiting is difficult. I’ve been on an intentional journey of learning to wait for the past 2ish years now, as a natural progression of my healing journey that kicked off sometime in 2020. It’s not as hard as it used to be, but I still have to <em>choose</em> to take a deep breath, pause, and stay still. There’s a lot to be learned in waiting. You discover life goes on, most of your problems weren’t <em>quite</em> as pressing as you thought, and there’s rest to be had you didn’t know you were missing. But I really, really want my plants to start flourishing. It’s been two days and I’m already impatient.</p>
<p>I like the word betweenspace; spellcheck is assuring me it’s not a word, but I named one of my upcoming <a href="https://ffm.bio/ethanbliese">ambient tracks</a> that, so…pretty sure it is. Waiting in the betweenspace. Riding the waves, watching the particles float by. There’s some stuff in and around this concept that I need to spend some time practicing putting into words, as it’s closely related to why I enjoy ambient music so much. I’ve had an idea to write about that for months now, just haven’t done it. Soon? Soon.</p>
<p>I haven’t written much since 2023, but I’d like to get back into some kind of rhythm again. Cheers to 2025 and waiting, drifting in the stillness.</p>
