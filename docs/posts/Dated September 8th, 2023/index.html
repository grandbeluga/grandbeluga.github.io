                <h2>Dated September 8th, 2023.</h2>
<p>I took a bike ride this morning and accidentally crossed over into another dimension for a few minutes. I didn't mean to, I just wasn't paying close enough attention and rode right through the portal on my bike. I wasn't there long, but I knew something was different. Time moved a little slower and it was clear that no one else existed here. It was a cemetery, after all. There was a strange, old building that was better off staying just how it was; doors barred, gates locked, and, presumably, any applicable spells in place. I didn't stay too long, but I did enjoy the view and the atmosphere for a little while. I made sure to ride back through the same row of trees, and I saw kids walking to school, so I'm pretty sure I made it through back to this lovely little piece of dimensional real estate we call reality. I've been thinking about it since, though. I might have to go back, see if there's anything else worth checking out. It was so quiet. Come to think of it, it still is...</p>
<p>I'm posting this in hopes that in the unfortunate event that I'm still over there, it'll somehow get through. To keep the record straight, I'm posting this on Friday, September 8th. If it shows up later, well...I hope they find me someday.</p>
