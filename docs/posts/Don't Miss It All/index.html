<p>You know, it won't be like this forever.</p>
<p>I sit upon the precipice of grand emotions, thinking back to the past and ruminating on the present. Back then, we didn't realize this wouldn't last forever. Now we know it, and we still can't do anything about it. I guess the only real difference is the awareness we get to have now. I'm trying to get these thoughts out in a way that makes sense, but it's not working super well so far. I think my point is that you get to choose to be present and appreciate the now for what it is. Every day may not be noteworthy, but each one has a better chance of sticking if you care.</p>
<p>Today is a good day, and life is good right now. I'm extremely blessed to be in the places I am, around the people I'm privileged to call my family and friends. I want to mark this day down, and the next, and all the ones after that. The worst part of depression is the way it tricks you into believing that life is nothing more than a haze, day after day. I've dealt with a bad bout of it this year, despite the first half being some of the best days of my adult life. Time to take the reins back and finish strong. I have a good feeling about it. I might find more to write about this subject, as it feels like there could be more. For now, this is today.</p>
<p>You could miss it all. Please don't miss it all.</p>
